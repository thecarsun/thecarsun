## Hello World!

**I'm Car** 👋

In my professional work life:

In my personal life:

**Code**  

  - Python enthusiast — I enjoy exploring ideas and building small projects in my free time
  - Example project I've built: [daily-news-Obsidian](https://github.com/thecarsun/daily-news-obsidian)  
    - A simple pipeline that pulls the top 5 news articles from a news API and generates a Markdown file in my Obsidian vault
    - Runs hands-off via a scheduled GitHub Action workflow
    - Why I built it: to stay informed without getting lost in the noise, distractions, clickbaits, and ads (*sorry*)
 
  - Project [LC-TAA](https://github.com/thecarsun/LC-TAA)
	- This project touches: Data collection (web scraping), data ingesting/processing, change detection, Data visualization of the challenges against the Trump Administration Actions
