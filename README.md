## Hello World!

**I'm Car** 👋

In my professional work life: 
- I work as a Sr. Technical Program Manager, *currently on a break and looking for my next adventure and team*
- Some of the areas I've been involved with in the past: 
	- **Consumer Mobile Apps**: feature development, launches, SDLC, CI/CD, and growth initiatives + more..
	- **Conesumer HW**: product developement, integration, delivery + more..
	- **AI/NLP/ML/LLM & Gen AI**: POCs, product development, MLOps/LLMOps, Responsible AI + more..

In my personal Life:

**Code**  
  - Python enthusiast — I enjoy exploring ideas and building small projects in my free time
  - Example project I've built: [daily-news-Obsidian](https://github.com/thecarsun/daily-news-obsidian)  
    - A simple pipeline that pulls the top 5 news articles from a news API and generates a Markdown file in my Obsidian vault
    - Runs hands-off via a scheduled GitHub Action workflow
    - Why I built it: to stay informed without getting lost in the noise, distractions, clickbaits, and ads (*sorry*)

**Learn**  
  - Nerd here, exploring courses on Coursera and Deeplearning.ai pretty often

**Read**  
  - Topics: non-fiction, economy, dystopian fiction, and true crime  

**Listen**  
  - Podcasts: The Mel Robbins Podcast, No Stupid Questions, Morning Brew Daily, True Crimes + more..
  - Taylor Swift has been the #1 most listened to artist on my Spotify for as long as Spotify was keeping tabs on me 
	- in 2025, I thought #1 would update to Chappell Roan but for whatever reason, Taylor is still #1 

**Think**  
  - Exploring various topics in frameworks in System Thinking and Critical Thinking

Something fun:
- Star Trek tos fan
- Spock is my spirit animal/alter ego
